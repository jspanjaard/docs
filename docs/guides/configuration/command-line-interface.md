# Command Line Interface

The **alis.exchange** command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for managing resources on **alis.exchange**.  You can use this tool to perform many common platform tasks either from the command line or in scripts and other automations. Some example use cases for the CLI:

- Create a new product / organisation;
- Deploy new versions of your product;
- Manage the build and deploy steps of your services; and
- Auto-generate infrastructure and implementation code.

## Install Prerequisites

Before you install the **alis.exchange** CLI, install the following prerequisites:

### Google Cloud SDK

The CLI makes use of Google Cloud SDK authentication to seamlessly authenticate your requests to **alis.exchange**.  

1. Install the latest version of Cloud SDK for your device by following the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2. Run `gcloud auth login` from your terminal to authenticate your local environment with Google user account via a web-based authorization flow.
    *NOTE* Ensure that you login using your account associated with alis.exchange.
3. Run `gcloud auth application-default login` to acquire new user credentials to use for Application Default Credentials ([ADC](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials)). These are used in calling Google APIs.

           
### Git

Git may already be installed on your device. Check by running `git --version`. A successful response should look similar to `git version 2.30.0`. If the command was not found, follow the [installation instructions](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).

### Connect Git with Google Cloud

Your Git needs to be configured with Google Cloud Source repositories. Credential helper scripts provide the information that Git needs to connect securely to Cloud Source Repositories using your Google Account credentials.

1. Access [this link](https://source.developers.google.com/auth/start?scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform&state=) and log in with your Google credentials
2. Copy the relevant script into your terminal

☑️ Check if this was successful by opening the `.gitcookies` file in Vim: `vim ~/.gitcookies`. If successful, the file should contain a `source.developers.google.com` entry.

## Install the CLI
